# The case for fully Bayesian optimisation in small-sample trials

[Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13960) is on arXve. The results were obtained by running each method (ML-II and FBO) with 101 random seeds from `seed=0` to `100`. The code was tested under Python `3.9.7`, Pyro `1.8.0`, and BoTorch `0.6.4`.
